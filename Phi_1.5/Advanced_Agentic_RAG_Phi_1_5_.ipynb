            "- **Strengths**:\n",
            "  - The report presents a comprehensive overview of the EU AI Act, logically outlining its purpose, legislative framework, and implications for digital medical products.\n",
            "  - Key articles and requirements are effectively summarized in a well-organized table, making important information easy to access.\n",
            "  - The challenges and considerations section is clear, highlighting pertinent issues manufacturers may face.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Areas for Improvement**:\n",
            "  - Include more examples or case studies illustrating the real-world implications of the EU AI Act on specific medical devices or manufacturers. This can enhance depth and relatability.\n",
            "  - Clarify what constitutes \"high-risk AI systems\" and how they differ from lower-risk counterparts, as this distinction is critical in the context of compliance.\n",

            "  - Ensure consistent bullet point formatting; using either full sentences or fragments but not both will improve visual clarity.\n",
            "  - In the \"Key Articles and Requirements\" table, consider adding a column for comments or implications to provide insights alongside each requirement.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Alignment with Objectives\n",
            "- Overall, the report aligns well with the objectives: to inform stakeholders about the EU AI Act and its implications. However, integrating more contextual information and real-world applications would enhance understanding and engagement.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Final Recommendations\n",
            "1. Add case studies or examples that illustrate the implications of the EU AI Act.\n",
